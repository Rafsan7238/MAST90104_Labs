Task 1

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
a = 1
b = 2
x = 3
```

```{r}
z = x^(a^b)
```

```{r}
z = (x^a)^b
```

```{r}
z = (3*x^3) + (2*x^2) + (6*x) + 1
```

```{r}
x = 123.01
z = floor(x)

z = z %% 100
z = z %/% 10
```

```{r}
z = z + 1
```

Task 2

```{r}
vec1 = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
```

```{r}
vec2 = rep(1:5, times = 1:5)
vec2
```

```{r}
mat1 = matrix(c(0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0), 3, 3)
mat1
```

```{r}
mat2 = matrix(c(0,2,3,0,5,0,7,0,0), 3, 3, byrow = TRUE)
mat2
```

Task 3

```{r}
vec3 = 1:100
vec3 = vec3[!(vec3 %% 2 == 0 | vec3 %% 3 == 0 | vec3 %% 7 == 0)]

vec3
```

Task 4

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
x <- 1
x[3] <- 3
y <- c()
y[2] <- 2
y[3] <- y[1]
y[2] <- y[4]
z[1] <- 0

# Last line will not work as z has been removed and does not exist anymore in the environment
```
